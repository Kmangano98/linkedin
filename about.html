    <h1>üë©‚Äçüî¨ About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Karla Mangano, a Master's student in Medical Biology at Paris Lodron University Salzburg. My academic journey is driven by a deep-seated curiosity about the molecular mechanisms underlying human health and disease. With a foundation in Physiology and Neuroscience from the University of Western Australia, I bring a multidisciplinary lens to biological research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I explore the interpretability of Knowledge-Primed Neural Networks (KPNNs) using single-cell CRISPR perturbation screens. My work combines machine learning and functional genomics to better understand transcriptional regulation and improve interpretability in bioinformatics models.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have practical experience in microbiology, immunogenomics, and high-throughput sequencing. I've also worked as a tutor in bioinformatics, NGS, and microbiology, where I discovered my love for communicating science in creative ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of science, I enjoy mushroom foraging, dog training, and building creative digital projects like this portfolio. I'm motivated by the opportunity to contribute to research that informs healthcare and promotes data-driven discovery.
